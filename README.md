Codecademy project #4 during the Data Science Path

In this portfolio project, I analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.

I also create a presentation about my findings from this OKCupid dataset.

The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions.
