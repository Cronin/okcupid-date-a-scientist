Codecademy project #4 during the Data Science Path

In this portfolio project, I analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.

I also create a presentation about your findings from this OKCupid dataset.

The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions.

# Project Goals:
- Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings
- Build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model

# Knowledge Required:
- Natural Language Processing
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
